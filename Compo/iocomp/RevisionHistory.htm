<H4>ActiveX and VCL/CLX Version 3.1.0 Service Pack 5</H4>
<H4>Bug Fixes:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed property editor lockup issues 
in ActiveX containers when using the Color, Font, and etc dialogs.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed scrolling issue with the plot 
legend. Would occur when the plot control was first resized such that not all 
legend items could be displayed and the scroll bars appeared. Then the user 
would need to <br>scroll the list down one or more items. When the plot control 
was then resized large enough to fit all legend items, the list would still be 
scrolled and the scroll buttons would disappear.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Added missing WordWrap checkbox in 
the iLabel property editor.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed the Plot axis Master-UI-Input 
issue that caused other axes to not respond to mouse-wheel movements.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed Plot Annotation bug that would 
occur when the X-Axis was in DateTime mode. There was an error in the span 
pixels calculation for the width of the annotation.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed PlotAnnotation OuterMargin 
being ignored when the style property is set to ipasTextBox and multi-line text 
is displayed.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed issue with the plot control 
axis labeling where when in the Prefix mode, the 0.0 value tick label would show 
up as 2.78f (0.000000000000278) due to floating point storage/rounding issues. 
The new code detects this rounding issue and displays a hard-coded &quot;0.0&quot; string.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed bug on the iXYPlot control 
data-cursor that would result in small inaccuracies with the returned X&amp;Y 
values.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed bug with Iocomp controls that 
support saving strings properties to file and contained multi-line text. The 
symptoms would be when reloading the properties, multi-line string properties 
would only load the first line and all other lines would be dropped. </LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed OnPositionOverMax and 
OnPositionUnderMin event not firing on Position/Scale type components.</LI>
<LI>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fixed resource leak in iLedRound 
control. Would result in a HRGN object being leaked each time the Led was drawn.</LI>

controls in the ActiveX version.</LI>
</OL>
<H4><BR>
</span>New Features:</H4>

<OL>

<LI>Added SpanMinimum, MaxMargin, and MinMargin properties to the axes Tracking 
features. Use SpanMinimum to limit the minimum value for the Span. Use the 
MaxMargin and MinMargin properties to provide a margin above or below the data. These properties are also used when performing a 
	ZoomToFit operation.</LI>
<LI>Added the ResetStartTimeOnFirstDataPoint property to the iPlotChannel 
	object. This property is useful if you are adding data with an elapsed time 
	using the AddYElapsedTime or AddYElapsedSeconds methods and you want the 
	first data-point to start at zero. </LI>
<LI>Added AllowOutOfOrderXValues and DrawOutOfOrderXValues properties to the 
	Plot control Channel type (iPlotChannel for VCL and iPlotChannelX for 
	ActiveX). The iPlotChannel is designed assuming that the X-Values are 
	incremental. This allows for high-speed drawing of the channel data using 
	the y = f(x) formula. For a default plot control setup, you will not receive 
	an error if you add data-points with an out-of-order X-Value. Set the 
	AllowOutOfOrderXValues property to False so that an exception is raised when 
	an out-of-order X-Value is added. If you need to have out-of-order x-values, 
	set the DrawOutOfOrderXValues property to True, but you will loose the 
	high-speed drawing optimization capability.</LI>
<LI>Added the following events to the Plot control...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelXAxis <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelYAxis <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelDataView <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelLegend <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelChannel <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelLimit <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelDataCursor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OnMouseWheelAnnotation<br>
	</LI>
	<br>
<LI>Added a CanFocus property to the follow plot sub-objects...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XAxis 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YAxis <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataView 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Channel 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataCursor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annotation</LI><br>
<br>
<LI>Added ClickRectLeft, ClickRectRight, ClickRectTop, and ClickRectBottom 
	properties to the iPlotAnnotation object (All properties are in pixels). 
	These properties where added to allow you to determine the extents of 
	annotations like the Text and TextBox which have their extents determined by 
	the Text, Font, and etc. attributes. These new properties are not calculated 
	until the plot is repainted. If you need to position another object based on 
	these property values immediately, you will need to call the ReCalcLayout 
	method to force a recalculation of all pixel based property values.</LI>
<LI>Added UseCachedInerpolatedData property to the plot control 
	iPlotDataCursor object. This property is used to speed up calls to the 
	GetInterpolatedYValue method. When this property is set to False, each call 
	to the GetInterpolatedYValue method requires a ReCalcLayout method call. If 
	you are in a loop calling GetInterpolatedYValue many times, performance can 
	suffer significantly. Typically, this scenario applies when using a curve 
	fitting interpolation style like Cubic-Spline, Polynomial, and etc. where 
	you want to iterate over the visible data to get the displayed interpolated 
	values. For this case, set UseCachedInerpolatedData to True, make any other 
	display settings, and then call the ReCalcLayout method once before looping 
	and calling GetInterpolatedYValue. Note: You are restricted to visible data 
	when using this technique. </LI>
<LI>Added Scalar and Offset properties to all opc-items. Used for scaling 
	and or applying an offset correction to an opc-item's data. On new opc-data 
	from the opc-server, the data is multiplied by the scalar before the offset 
	is applied. This feature is only support on opc data that is of type real or 
	integer. The scalar and offset is not applied to data with types like 
	Boolean, String, and etc. The PlotChannel adds an OPCScalar and OPCOffset 
	property that is used for the y-value. The XYPlotChannel adds an OPCScalar, 
	OPCOffset, OPCScalar2 and OPCOffset2 property. The OPCItemName, OPCScalar, 
	OPCOffset are used for the x-value and the OPCItem2Name, OPCScalar2, 
	OPCOffset2 are used for the Y-value.</LI>
<LI>Added options to allow showing and customization of data-points hints to 
	the user. Set the channel ShowDataPointHints property to True to allow a 
	hint box to be shown next to the data-point. The plot must also be the 
	select mode and the data-point markers must also be visible for this option 
	to be enabled. By default, the x&amp;y value for the data-point will be shown 
	and will be formatted using the respective axes labeling formatting. To 
	provide your own formatting, use the OnDataPointCustomizeHint event and 
	change the AText parameter to the desired text you want displayed.</LI>
<LI>Added OnMouseDownDataPoint, OnMouseMoveDataPoint, and OnMouseUpDataPoint 
	events to the plot channel objects. These events will only fire when the 
	channel is enabled, the plot is in the select mode, and data-point markers 
	are shown on the channel.</LI>
<LI>Added Image property to the Plot Annotation object. When this property 
	is set to a non null value, the ImageIndex and ImageListIndex properties are 
	ignored even if they point to a valid image in one of the three different 
	imagelists. Note: The Style of the annotation must also be set to 
	&quot;ipasImage&quot; for the image to be displayed. The lower left pixel of the image 
	is used to set the transparent color of the image. If you do not want the 
	image to be transparent, make sure to set this pixel to a color that does 
	not match any other color in the image. You can also use the new 
	ImageLoadFromFile method to load the image directly from a file. Also added 
	an ImageClear method to make it easy to clear out the image in many 
	different ActiveX development environments.</LI>
<LI>Added None to the TiPlotAxesControlStyle which is used by the 
	PlotDataView AxesControlMouseStyle and AxesControlWheelStyle properties. 
	These new enumeration allows you to independently turn of the DataView Mouse 
	and Wheel axes control.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to load the iSwitchLed Glyph property image inside of the 
	Iocomp design-time property editor. </LI>
<LI>Added ability to load the iRotationDisplay Picture property image inside 
	of the Iocomp design-time property editor.</LI>
<LI>Added property ShowDisabledState to the iSwitchRotary, iSwitchSlider, 
	iSlider, and iKnob control. This property allows you to control whether the 
	control draws itself in a disabled state when the Enabled property is set to 
	False. This feature is helpful when you have background colors that do not 
	contrast will be disabled text and borders that are drawn using black and 
	gray colors.</LI>
<LI>Added Image rotation capability to the iObjectCanvas control. Use the 
	GetObjectImageRotation and SetObjectImageRotation methods on the 
	iObjectCanvas to Get or Set the rotation of the image object.</LI>
<LI>Added new PlotAnnotation style called ipasRectangle2. The ipasRectangle2 
	style uses the X, Y, X2, and Y2, properties of the annotation instead of the 
	X, Y, Width, and Height like on the ipasRectangle style. The main reason for 
	this addition is to eliminated the wobble in the annotation when resizing 
	it. The wobble occurs due to aliasing of the mouse movements along with 
	dividing it evenly into the new Width and or Height value.</LI>
<LI>Added a new property to the PlotAnnotation and PlotLimit called 
	SelectModeOnlyInteraction. This property is set to true by default meaning 
	that the plot object will not be mouse interactive will the plot data-view 
	is not in the select mode. Setting this property to a false will cause the 
	object to be interactive in any data-view mode (Select, Zoom-box, or 
	Data-Cursor). The main benefit of this property is to allow these objects to 
	generate mouse-move events regardless of the mode of the data-view.</LI>
<LI>Upgrade the AngularGauge to hide the last tick label when the 
	ArcRangeDegrees is set to 360 degrees. Before this upgrade, you would have 
	the Min label overlapped by the Max label. Only the Min label will now be 
	shown.</LI>
<LI>Added 2 additional color sections to the iLedBar and iLedSpiral 
	controls. There are 4 new properties called SectionColor4, SectionColor5, 
	SectionEnd3, and SectionEnd4. The SectionCount property upper limit has been 
	changed from 3 to 5 to support the two addition color sections. </LI>
<LI>Added VK_APPS key support to plot object pop-up menu support. The pop-up 
	menu will now pop-up when hitting the menu-list keyboard key.</LI>
<LI>Addded OnAnnotationMoveUser event to the plot controls. This event will 
	fire anytime the user moves an annotation and the index of the annotation is 
	passed in the event handler parameters.</LI>
<LI>Addded OnAnnotationResizeUser event to the plot controls. This event 
	will fire anytime the user moves an annotation and the index of the 
	annotation is passed in the event handler parameters.</LI>
<LI>Added the following properties, methods, and events which were present 
	on the Plot control main VCL interface, but were missing on the ActiveX 
	interface...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>Properties</b> :&nbsp;&nbsp;PrinterPaperHeightCentimeter, PrinterPaperHeightInches, 
	PrinterPaperHeightPixels, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PrinterPaperWidthCentimeters, PrinterPaperWidthInches, 
	PrinterPaperWidthPixels, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PrintXStart, PrintXStop.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Methods</b> :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	PreviewChart, PrintAdjustXSpanToMinutesPerMillimeter, PrintSizeToFillPage.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Events</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OnBeforePrintPage</LI><br>
<br>
<LI>Add CloseAllServerConnections method to the iOPCManager component. This 
	method allows you to force all OPCServer connections to close. This method 
	is useful when the DCOM connection to the OPC server has been lost and you 
	wish to terminate all connections from the iOPCManger's point of view. After 
	this method has been called, re-add your opc-items, or call the Activate 
	method on the existing opc-items have the connect re-established. </LI>
<LI>Added TextLineAlignment property to the plot annotation sub-object. This 
	property allows you to specify how multiple lines of text are aligned 
	horizontally in the annotation. Applies to the Text and TextBox style of 
	annotation.</LI>
<LI>Added the ability for the user to zoom-box while in the scroll/zoom mode 
	by using the right mouse button. Before, the user had to switch the plot 
	control into the zoom-box mode to be able zoom into a specific area using 
	the left mouse button. The user can now perform a zoom-box operation using 
	the right mouse button while in the scroll/zoom mode. The left mouse button 
	is still used to scroll/zoom as before. The user must move the mouse more 
	than 5 pixels in either direction to initiate the zoom-box operation. If the 
	user moves the mouse less then 5 pixels in either direction while the mouse 
	is down, then releases the mouse, the pop-up menu will still appear as 
	before. </LI>
<LI>Added the AxesControlAllowInSelectMode property to the Plot Data-View 
	object. This property allows scrolling and zooming of the plot control while 
	in the Select mode (Also assuming the AxesControlEnabled property is set to 
	True). Before, you had to turn off the select mode to be able to scroll or 
	zoom the view (Also assuming the Zoom-Box mode has not selected). The new 
	right-click zoom-box mode is supported by this option. </LI>
<LI>Added Visible, BackGroundColor, FontColor, and UseControlFontColor 
	properties to the Keyboard control button properties. With these properties, 
	you can hide or customize the look of a specific keyboard button.</LI>
<LI>Added support for adding 2 or more OPC-Items using the same property 
	name on the control. Typically, this option would be used to control 2 
	different digital signal's on the OPC-Server.</LI>
<LI>Added OPCItem2Name, OPCScalar2, and OPCOffset2 properties to the Plot 
	control channel object. These properties give you the ability to have a 
	separate OPC item for the X and Y value for each data-point and also to 
	scale and offset the value. Normally, the OPCItemName property is used to 
	specify the OPC-Item for the Y-Value and the X-Value is generated based on 
	the OPCXValueSource property setting. When having the X &amp; Y value sourced 
	from an OPC-Item, use the OPCItemName property to specify the OPC-Item for 
	the data-point X-Value and use the OPCItem2Name property to specify the 
	OPC-Item for the data-point Y-Value.</LI>
<LI>Added ability for the Plot control Label object to support images. Use 
	the ImageListIndex and ImageIndex property to use an image from one of the 3 
	internal ImageList's in the plot control. Or use the Image property or 
	ImageLoadFromFile method to load an image through code dynamically. Use the 
	ImageClear method to dynamically clear the image. The image will be centered 
	horizontally using the Alignment property of the label. The MarginLeft 
	property is used if the Alignment is set to iahLeft. The MarginRight 
	property is used if the Alignment is set to iahRight. Both the MarginLeft 
	and MarginRight properties are ignored if the Alignment is set to iahCneter.</LI>

<H4>Distribution Changes:</H4>
<H4><span style="font-weight: 400">The "iOPC.dll" has now been renamed to "iOPC2.dll". The new "iOPC2.dll" has interface changes to make it compatible with our .Net components/controls. Version 3 SP3 for ActiveX &amp; VCL and Version 3 SP2 for .Net must now use the new iOPC2.dll during development and distribution. If you have OPC applications developed with our ActiveX or VCL controls prior to Version 3 SP3, you must still distribute them with the older "iOPC.dll". It is recommended that both dll's be distributed to the System32 directory on the client machine and they can coexist together.<BR>

<H4>ActiveX and VCL/CLX Version 3.0.4 Service Pack 2</H4>
<H4>Bug Fixes:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Fixed Plot Pack Table bug which would incorrectly size the height of horizontal tables.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack axis tracking bug introduced in Version 3.0.2 SP1 which would prevent correct tracking when the tracking style was set to Expand/Collapse.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in table sizing if located on top or bottom of the DataView.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in the iPlotAxis Zoom-To-Fit feature that was using non-visible points to determine the new min and span.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in all components that would prevent a window shutdown while the components were running.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in Plot Pack Property editor regarding the addition of labels through the layout manager.&nbsp; The incorrect label would be loaded when selecting "Edit..." through the layout manager.</LI>
<LI>Fixed LoadPropertiesFromFile and Save PropertiesFromFile where the RingBuffer property would be 0 regardless of your current setting or the setting stored from the SavePropertiesFromFile method when loading the properties when the channel is set to the FullFeature data style.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in iEdit, iAnalogOutput, and iIntegerOutput components that caused the text displayed to be truncated when the text was wider than the width of the control.&nbsp; You would be unable to scroll back to edit the text that was not in view.</LI>
<LI>Fixed DataView gridline bug when using non solid lines.&nbsp; Colored lines would sometimes be drawn between the dots or dashes.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack runtime property editor bug where radio group titles would not be translated.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug with ActiveX property editors under the Citect SCADA development environment where the property editor would lockup when clicking on buttons when there was a list box on the same property editor tab.</LI>
<LI>Fixed ActiveX bug where SetWindowPos() call in Visual C++ would generate an exception.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in iObjectCanvas where overlapped objects would be misidentified in the OnClickObject event.&nbsp; The lowest ZOrder object would be identified in the OnClickObject event as being clicked, even though an object with a higher ZOrder that overlapped the object.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack Data Cursor bug where a hidden hint would still be "clickable", interfering with selection of the DataCursor line.</LI></OL>

<H4>New Features:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Upgraded Plot Component Compact Interval Data Style to support Ring Buffer. </LI>
<LI>Upgraded Plot Component Compact Interval Data Style to support relocating the origin X-Value of the Data Set by modifying the DataX[0] property of the channel.&nbsp; The DataX value of the first data point (i.e. DataX[0]) dictates the origin of the data set for that channel when using the Compact Interval Data Style, since the interval between each data point is fixed to save memory space.&nbsp; Modifying DataX[0], however, doesn't change the fixed interval set after adding the first two data points.&nbsp; To change the interval, clear the channel and re-add all channel data.</LI>
<LI>Improved Plot Pack draw performance for multiple Y-Axes.</LI>
<LI>Added DataFile Column Separator property to allow for text tabs or commas.</LI>
<LI>Added DataFile Format property to allow for Text or Compact Interval (optimized for the Compact Interval Data Type) formatted files.</LI>
<LI>Added OnResize to the TiPlot and TiXYPlot VCL Event Handlers.</LI>
<LI>Added A3, A4, and A5 paper size support to the built-in Plot pack printing feature.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to change Compact Interval start reference after data has already been added to the channel by setting the X-Value of the first data point.</LI>
<LI>Added ChannelNameColorStyle to the iPlotLegend object.&nbsp; Allows the channel name text that is displayed to track other object colors.&nbsp; Possible values are Font, Channel Color, X-Axis Font Color, or Y-Axis Font Color.</LI>
<LI>Added PointerColor and PointerHighlightColor properties to the iSwitchRotary and the iSwitchSlider components.</LI>
<LI>Added GetPointersVisible and SetPointersVisible to all Gauge Components.</LI>
<LI>Added to the Plot components two new properties: LastPropertiesFileName, LastDataFileName and three additional events: OnAfterSaveProperties, OnAfterLoadData, and OnAfterSaveData.&nbsp; Using these new three events in addition to the existing event: OnAfterLoadProperties, you can be notified when the user has saved/loaded data or property files.&nbsp; The two new properties are useful for determining the filename used during the load or save operation.</LI>
<LI>Updated iImageDisplay to not draw the image as "disabled" when the Enabled property is set to FALSE.</LI>
<LI>Updated iPlotAxis to include a new ZoomToFitFast method, and a new TrackingStyle called ExpandCollapseFast.&nbsp; The older ZoomToFit and ExpandCollapse features would iterate through the entire data set to find the high and low point of the data when scaling.&nbsp; The new Fast methods use the RunningXMax, RunningXMin, RunningYMin, and/or RunningYMin methods of the channel object which cache the historical Max/Min values, thereby greatly speeding up the ZoomToFit and ExpandCollapse features. <B>Warning</B>: do not use this new feature if you modify historical data <U>unless</U> you manually call the appropriate GetXMax/GetXMin or GetYMax/GetYMin functions to force an update of the corresponding running totals. (e.g. if you modify the Y-value of a previous data point, you must call GetYMax and GetYMin to update the "RunningYMax" and "RunningYMin" for the new "Fast" features to work correctly. ).</LI>
<LI>Updated iPlotLegend with two new properties: ViewStartIndex and ViewStopIndex. These properties are useful when needing to know the topmost and bottommost indexes of the visible channels in the Legend.&nbsp; For example, if you have 100 channels in the chart, and the Legend is currently showing channel 52-60, then ViewStartIndex=51 and ViewStopIndex=59.</LI>
<LI>Added Transparent and Stretch properties and features to the iImageDisplay component.</LI>
<LI>Added Stretch property to iRotationDisplay component.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded iSwitchPanel AutoSize to take the height into consideration in addition to the width when adjusting the KnobRadius property.</LI>
<LI>Added OnClickPointer event hander to the iAngularGauge, iLinearGauge, iAngularLogGauge, and iLogGauge components.&nbsp; (Not currently supported under CLX).</LI>
<LI>Added PointerBitmap property and ispsBitmap enumeration to the PointerStyle property of the iSlider and iSwitchSlider components.</LI>
<LI>Added SetValueNoEvent method, ValueMax property, and ValueMin property to the iIntegerOutput component.</LI>
<LI>Updated Precision property on the iAnalogDisplay and iAnalogOutput components to support -1 to indicate the "G" formatting style.&nbsp; The "G" formatting style will format numbers as the shortest possible string.&nbsp; It will display the value either as a whole number or exponent, whichever is shortest.&nbsp; If the precision is unknown at design-time this will ensure that all digits to the right of the decimal place are shown.</LI>
<LI>Added OnAfterOpenEditor and OnAfterCloseEditor event handlers to the Plot Pack components to notify when the run-time property editor is opened and closed.</LI>
<LI>Added an Arc object to the iObjectCanvas component.&nbsp; The following methods have been added to support this new object type...<BR>
AddArc<BR>
SetObjectAngles <BR>
SetObjectStartAngle<BR>
SetObjectStopAngle <BR>
GetObjectStartAngle<BR>
GetObjectStopAngle </LI>
<LI>Plot Pack iPlotChannel object was updated to support a new interpolation style: Differential Terminated.&nbsp; This style is the same as the Differential interpolation style, except there is no line drawn from the last data point out to infinity.</LI>
<LI>Added RotationDesiredSpacing property to the iSwitchRotary component.&nbsp; Supports 22.5, 45, or 90 degree specification.&nbsp; The desired portion means that it will only use the angle specified if the "number of positions" * "desired angle" &lt;= "360 degrees".</LI>
<LI>Added Candlestick option to the iPlot Channel High-Low feature.&nbsp; Below is a list of new properties added to support this new feature...<BR>
HighLowStyle<BR>
HighLowShadowColor <BR>
HighLowBullishColor<BR>
HighLowBearishColor</LI>
<LI>Upgraded iCompass and iDualCompass to allow changing of the direction captions. Added the following properties...<BR>

SCaption<BR>
ECaption<BR>
WCaption<BR>
NECaption<BR>
NWCaption<BR>
SECaption<BR>
SWCaption</LI>
<LI>Upgraded Plot Pack Axes labeling to support rotated text.&nbsp; Can be set to 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree rotation.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded iObjectCanvas component to support polygons.&nbsp; Below are the following methods added to support this feature...<BR>
AddPolygon<BR>
ObjectAddPolyPoint <BR>
ObjectClearPolyPoints</LI>
<LI>Added Print Preview support to the Plot Pack printing feature.</LI>
<LI>Added Plot Pack OnBeforeDataCursorUpdate event.&nbsp; Allows customization of formatting or other customization before the actual strings are generated for display on the cursor.</LI>
<LI>Added PNG image support to all components: SaveImageToPNG and GetBytesPNG methods.&nbsp; Plot pack save dialog updated to support PNG.</LI>
<LI>Added JPEG image support to CLX components under Linux.</LI>
<LI>Added Plot Pack printing support for CLX components under Linux.</LI>
<LI>Added new iOPCManager non-visual component for use in conjunction with our OPC-enabled components.&nbsp; Allows combining of OPC connections to servers through a common connection. Previously, each individual component would make its own connection to the OPC server and its own group.&nbsp; The new iOPCManager along with the new iOPC.dll improves performance by utilizing Shared Server Connections and now adds support fro adding groups that can be shared among OPC Items of our components.&nbsp; The iOPCManager component has a visual property editor for adding/removing groups as well as properties and methods that can be used to modify groups at runtime.&nbsp; Two new events, OnAfterGroupUpdate and OnBeforeGroupUpdate provide notification of updates that occur among the OPC Items utilizing a particular group.</LI>
<LI>Added multi-line support to the Plot Pack Data Cursor Hint.&nbsp; Use chr(13) for manual line breaks.</LI>
<LI>Added the following to OPCItems...<BR>
ActivateSuspend method<BR>
GroupName property</LI>
<LI>Added OPC DeleteItem method for deleting individual OPC Items at runtime.</LI>
<LI>Added new TextBox style (differs from TextRectangle) to Plot Pack annotations.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Added 24 new event handlers to plot pack.<BR>
MouseDown<BR>
MouseMove<BR>
MouseUp<BR>
...events for all 8 basic Plot Objects: Channels, X-Axes, Y-Axes, Tables, DataView, DataCursors, Legend, and Annotations.</LI>
<LI>Added transparency support to Tank.</LI>
<LI>Added three new styles to Tank: Cutout2, Large Window, and Custom.</LI>
<LI>Tank Custom cutout style uses two new methods: CustomPointsAdd, CustomPointsClear.&nbsp; Use CustomPointsAdd to add at least three points to make a closed polygon.&nbsp; Added points are in the range of 0-100, representing percentage (%) of the width and height of the component.&nbsp; It is recommended to restrict points between 10-90% when the tank is shown.</LI>
<LI>Added vertical and horizontal orientation to Tank.</LI>
<LI>Added scale reverse to Tank.</LI>
<LI>Added OPCActivateSuspend, OPCActive, OPCUpdateSuspend, and OPCUpdateResume to the iPlot and iXYPlot component Channel objects.</LI>
<LI>Added HitTest method to all Plot Pack sub-objects (channel, y-axis, x-axis, annotation, label, etc.).&nbsp; Allows you to test each sub-object and determine if an x/y coordinate exists within the sub-object or not.</LI>
<LI>Added Theme support to the CLX version of the components under both Windows and Linux.</LI></OL>

<P><HR SIZE=0></P>
<H4>ActiveX and VCL/CLX Version 3.0.2 Service Pack 1</H4>
<H4>Bug Fixes:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Fixed problem in iPlot and iXYPlot with adding null data points and the ring buffer.&nbsp; In previous versions if you had enabled the ring-buffer and were adding null data points to the channel, data would sometimes be corrupted.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in iSwitchLED where the accelerator key(&amp; placed before accelerator key), though it would still function, would not be shown with an underline but would show the "&amp;" character instead. </LI>
<LI>Fixed several issues with the CLX version of the Instrumentation and Plot Pack components.</LI>
<LI>Help file corrections.&nbsp; Fixed VCL/CLX help file integration issue with Delphi and C++ Builder where event help topics would not come up properly in the object inspector when you press F1.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack LoadPropertiesFromFile method where Label objects were not properly loaded.&nbsp; If you would load properties from a file, you would get a miss positioned, extra label object than expected.</LI>
<LI>Fixed memory leak in Plot Pack components which would occur only when the component was destroyed.</LI>
<LI>Fixed border style bug in iPanel component.&nbsp; The border style property would not properly stream this style property.</LI>
<LI>Fixed font size issues with the CLX component property editors under Linux.</LI></OL>

<H4>New Features:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Added Table support for Plot Pack Components.&nbsp; Allows you to position custom tables anywhere around the DataView.&nbsp; Allows unlimited number of rows and columns with individual formatting for each column.&nbsp; Supports scrolling if the number of rows exceeds the display area.&nbsp; Allows you to specify the text in each cell.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded iAnalogOutput key-filter to support the current regional setting for the decimal separator character.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded iLedMatrix indicator caption to support multiple lines of text.&nbsp; Accepts line feed, carriage return, or both to indicate a break in the line.</LI>
<LI>Added methods and properties for customizing the tick labels on the Plot Pack Axes.&nbsp; Now supports a custom mode where you can add your own custom labels (specify the text) at specified locations.</LI>
<LI>Added RecalcLayout to recalculate all coordinates of all Plot sub-objects without having to wait for the next repaint.</LI>
<LI>Added TransferChannelData method to Plot components to allow transferring of data from one channel to another.&nbsp; Used to allow easy transfer of basic (Only X, Y, null, and empty properties.&nbsp; All other data point and channel properties are not transferred) data from one channel to another. {Appends Data.&nbsp; Need to clear out destination channel for exact copy}.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded Plot Pack Annotations to support individual clip to axis property.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded LineX and LineY Plot Annotations to extend to the full extent of the DataView by utilizing the new Annotation-specific clip to axes property.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded iPlot Plot Pack Channel to support High Low graphs/data points.&nbsp; You must have the Channel Data Style set to Full Feature to utilize this feature. Added the following methods and properties...<BR>
AddHighLow<BR>
DataHigh<BR>

HighLowOpenHeight<BR>
HighLowCloseShow <BR>
HighLowCloseColor <BR>
HighLowCloseWidth <BR>
HighLowCloseHeight</LI>
<LI>Added ForceStacking property to Axes.&nbsp; During normal layout, only touching ends of stacked axes would take the Stacking End Margin spacing into account.&nbsp; By setting this property to True, then all axes will use the Stacking End Margins on all ends.&nbsp; This was done to ensure that outer, stacked axes will have the same end margins as all axes in the same ZOrder.&nbsp; If this property is set to False (the default), then the axes will behave as previously indicated.</LI>
<LI>Added PasswordChar property to iEdit to support display of password characters.</LI>
<LI>Added the following events to all visual ActiveX controls that were missing them...<BR>
OnMouseDown<BR>

<LI>Added Mouse Wheel Zooming support to the Plot Pack Axes.</LI>
<LI>Added CTRL key support to the Plot Pack Axes and DataView as a NOT operator to switch between scrolling and zooming when clicking and dragging the axes.</LI>
<LI>Added SHIFT key support to the Plot Pack.&nbsp; If the MouseStyle (or WheelStyle) is not set to Both, then the SHIFT key will switch between the X-Axis or Y-Axis style.&nbsp; If the MouseStyle (or WheelStyle) is set to Both, then the SHIFT key is ignored.&nbsp; Simultaneous use of both the SHIFT key and CTRL key is supported.</LI>
<LI>Plot Pack DataView upgraded to support mouse movements and mouse wheel movements to support scrolling and zooming of the axes.&nbsp; This is similar to the zooming and scrolling feature in our older iStripChart control.&nbsp; Added the following properties to the DataView...<BR>
AxisControlEnabled (Default = False)<BR>
AxisControlMouseStyle (X-Axis, Y-Axis, or Both, Default = Both)<BR>
AxisControlWheelStyle (X-Axis, Y-Axis, or Both, Default = X-Axis)</LI>
<LI>Upgraded Right-Clicking Plot Pack code to support right-clicking channel trace lines to bring up the channel pop-up menu.&nbsp; Supports clicking anywhere on the trace line and within 10 pixels of the trace line.</LI>

<OL>

<LI>Fixed OptionSaveAllProperties property on Plot Pack components.&nbsp; The property was previously ignored when saving properties to a file.</LI>
<LI>Fixed ModeComboBox where if you selected an item and then deleted all items, the ItemIndex property would still point to the deleted item which would cause errors when accessed.</LI>
<LI>Fixed tabbed-dialog bug in Visual C++ where the application would crash if one of our components was on the tabbed-dialog and you alt-tabbed to another application and then back to the Visual C++ application.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack bug where if you delete an Axis and then re-add the same type of Axis, the Channel's associated axis pointer would not reconnect to the new axis until the next repaint. This would result in functions such as ZoomToFit on the Axis not working correctly until after a control repaint.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack bug where an extra margin would have been incorrectly added for any plot object placed in-between the DataView and an axis, and that object had its Visible property set to FALSE.</LI>
<LI>Fixed iXYPlotX Plot Pack ActiveX bug where the Image List and Translations were not being streamed.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Help File integration into Borland Delphi and Borland C++ Builder Versions 6 and higher.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in Strip Chart where the Auto Scale would malfunction, shifting data out of view if the AutoScaleHysterisis property was non-zero and AutoScale was enabled.</LI></OL>

<LI>Updated Plot Pack channel fill routines to support digital channel option as well as cubic-spline,&nbsp; polynomial, rational, and differential interpolation styles.</LI>
<LI>Updated Plot Pack cursor to support cubic-spline, polynomial, and rational interpolation styles.&nbsp; Data Cursors already supported digital and differential interpolation styles.</LI>
<LI>Added Layer Ordering&nbsp; support to all Plot Pack objects.&nbsp; Currently only has an effect on objects that are displayed in the DataView area (e.g. channels, annotations, limits, Axes setup as Cartesian, etc,).&nbsp; DataCursors are currently always&nbsp; forced to the topmost layer and cannot be changed.&nbsp; The highest layer number are drawn on top of lower layer numbers.&nbsp; If the layer numbers are the same, then the Iocomp internal layering order is preserved (i.e. the old layering order is used from previous versions).&nbsp; By default, all objects are set to a layer order of 100 for backwards compatibility.</LI>
<LI>Stats page upgraded to clear itself when changing channel objects in the runtime property editor.&nbsp; It would previously show the previous channel's information.&nbsp; The page is not refreshed automatically since auto refresh may cause a performance decrease when refreshing information concerning very large datasets.</LI>
<LI>Layout Viewer upgrade to support automatic resizing of objects when attempting to stack using drag and drop.&nbsp; You can simply drag and drop a plot object on another of the same type to have them proportionally sized and stacked automatically. Previously you needed to manually size the objects before you could stack them in the Layout Viewer.</LI>
<LI>Added <B>PrinterName</B> property to the Plot Pack components to specify which printer to use when using the built-in printing facilities.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded Plot Pack Run-time Property Editor Channel Stats page speed.</LI>
<LI>Added new <B>OnDataCursorCustomizeHint</B> event to the Plot Pack components.</LI>
<LI>Added <B>FlatButtons</B> and <B>SmallButtons</B> properties to the Plot Pack components Toolbar object.&nbsp; Provides smaller and/or flat-button-styled buttons in the built-in toolbar.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded the Plot Pack Layout Viewer in design-time property editor with new right-click, context sensitive menu to provide add, delete, hide, and show functions to Layout Viewer Plot Objects.</LI>
<LI>Plot Pack Data Cursor object upgraded to support pointing to all channels in addition to pointing to individual channels.&nbsp; When pointing to all channels, the Data Cursor is hidden, and by default, all channel cursor data is displayed in the Legend.&nbsp; Optionally you can turn off the display of the data in the legend and display the data in your own legend by reading the data directly from each channel.</LI>

<B><I>Important New Legend Properties Note and Discussion</B></I> - Col is used in the property names to distinguish between the references to Column in other properties of the legend.&nbsp; When we refer to the property ColumnSpacing or ColumnTitlesVisible, we are referring to the internal columns of each legend entry such as "Marker", "Line", "Title" , "X-Value", "Max", "Min", "Mean", etc..&nbsp; The properties using "Col" refer to the multiple-column feature that we have just added where multiple columns of channels (and their associated displayed information) can be displayed instead of a single column in the legend.&nbsp; For example, when a legend is horizontal, you will probably have an average of 5 columns of channels displayed.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
This features has also been added in such a way as to be backwards compatible with previous versions of our Plot Pack components.&nbsp; Therefore, the new properties above will default to emulate the behavior of the original legend.&nbsp; However, to take full advantage of the "automated" nature of the new legend, we recommend that you set the following properties to the following values.&nbsp; In a future service pack release of Version 3.x, we will set the defaults to these values, be can't right now due to backwards compatibility concerns...</P>

<LI>Added new OPC event handler to all OPC-enabled components: OnBeforeNewOPCData.&nbsp; This event passes the index of the OPC item and the variant data value by reference (pointer reference) so that you can modify or scale the value before it is passed to the component and before the standard event handlers are called.</LI>
<LI>Added independent Cursor and Legend data point value formatting to the Plot Pack axis objects.&nbsp; Each channel is associated with a Y-Axis and X-Axis.&nbsp; Each axis is responsible for specifying the formatting of displayed data for values associated for that axis.&nbsp; This goes for channel data displayed in other objects, such as in the cursor and/or legend objects.&nbsp; By default, all objects display X and Y values formatted as shown in the respective axis.&nbsp; For example, if the X-Axis is formatted as date/time "hh:nn:ss", then X-values displayed in the Data Cursor are displayed formatted the same way.&nbsp; You can now override this default formatting, and specify that the formatting be different when displayed in either the Legend or Data Cursor Objects.

<LI>Updated installer to support Delphi 7 VCL and CLX components.</LI>
<LI>Upgraded Plot Pack to correctly display long labels in the X and Y-axes so that they are not "cropped" when near the edge of the component.&nbsp; This has resulted in a change in the layout of the plot component objects, particularly the Legend and Label objects.&nbsp; Now, the Label object and Legend object top/bottom/left/right margin properties are strictly interpreted.&nbsp; This will result in the gap between the Legend and the Data View as well as Labels and the Data View shrinking to be exactly the margin specified by the top/bottom/left/right margin properties. <BR>
<BR>
Since the default top/bottom/left/right margins for the Legend are set at a default of one character, the margin between the Data View and the Legend will now be exactly one character.&nbsp; Since the default top/bottom/left/right margins for the Label is set at a default of zero characters, the margin between the Data View and the label will now be exactly 0 characters (plus font specific kerning).&nbsp; This means that with most fonts, there will be a kerning gap (extra space added below the baseline to accommodate characters that are generally drawn below the baseline such as "j" or "g"), but letters&nbsp; that go below the kerning baseline will now touch the Data View.&nbsp; To fix this, we recommend setting the margin nearest the Data View to 0.25 characters (or alternatively setting all margins for all labels to 0.25 characters).&nbsp; This change should not affect most users in a negative way, but will slightly change the visual layout of some objects.</LI>
<LI>iObjectCanvas now supports loading images into a built-in image list that can also stream into your form.&nbsp; You can also load image lists from resources using name or ID.</LI>
<LI>Added GetDisplayXToPixelsX and GetDisplayYToPixelsY to iObjectCanvas.&nbsp; Allows conversion between the component's display units and pixels on the component.</LI>
<LI>Added new iImageDisplay component.&nbsp; Allows loading of multiple bitmap frames, and controllable animation framerate.</LI>
<LI>Updated Plot Pack component backgrounds to support gradient colors.</LI>
<LI>Added new iPipe component.&nbsp; Includes 3d straight pipe and animation capabilities.</LI>
<LI>Added new iPipeJoint component. To be used with the iPipe component.</LI>
<LI>Added new iIntegerOutput component.&nbsp; Similar to iAnalogOutput, but supports Integer only output.&nbsp; Supports Integer, Hex, Binary, and Octal formatting styles.</LI>
<LI>Added new iScope Component.&nbsp; True Analog/Digital Oscilloscope component with built-in Trigger.</LI>
<LI>New VCL/CLX, ActiveX WinHelp, and ActiveX HTML Help for MSDN (Pre January 2002 
Edition) Files including many corrections.</LI>
<LI>Added new iLCDMatrix component.&nbsp; Includes 5x7 built-in character font for displaying 5x7 dot-matrix display text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also supports loading external character sets of custom size.&nbsp; Several additional 5x8 character sets are included.&nbsp; An external font editor is available for download from our website.</LI>

<H4>ActiveX and VCL/CLX Version 2.1.2 Service Pack 6</H4>
<H4>Bug Fixes:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Fixed "Interface Not Supported" exception in Visual Basic.NET and C#.NET that occurred with the Plot Pack. </LI>
<LI>Fixed problem where popup dialogs and runtime property editors would block other threads from accessing the component while they were visible.&nbsp; Unnecessary Lock and Unlocks by these dialogs were removed.</LI>
<LI>Redesigned the Iocomp Theme Panel component in the Iocomp Design-Time property editors to fix a bug under Windows 95/98/ME operating systems when applying changes.&nbsp; Nested panel components within the theme panel were causing conflicts with the Windows API combo boxes that were used.</LI>
<LI>Redesigned the Iocomp Theme Panel auto-centering code for compatibility under CLX.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in iModeComboBox VCL component where the OnChange and OnChangeUser events would not fire under Delphi 4-5 and C++ Builder 4-5.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in Plot Pack Annotations when used with logarithmic axes.&nbsp; The annotation would size logarithmically instead of linearly when doing manual sizing with the mouse at runtime.</LI>
<LI>Fixed ActiveX compatibility issues with Microsoft Visual Studio.NET.&nbsp; Components now successfully stream and function with managed VB.NET and C#.NET applications.&nbsp; ActiveX components already were compatible with Visual C++ .NET.&nbsp; See the Iocomp ActiveX Release Notes for any issues with porting older Visual Basic 5/6 applications to VB.NET using our ActiveX components.</LI>
<LI>Fixed absolute positioning bug in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Component would always be positioned at the origin (upper left-hand corner) of the web page if absolute positioning was used with our components.</LI>
<LI>Fixed misspelling for default filename in the Plot Pack Save JPEG/BITMAP/Metafile dialog.</LI>
<LI>Limited DateTime format dates to years between 1400 to 9000.&nbsp; This resolves zooming errors that occurred when trying to zoom past these limits.</LI>
<LI>Fixed multiple pointer streaming issue in the ActiveX Gauge Components.&nbsp; If multiple pointers were setup at Design-Time, they would not be streamed correctly to the form. </LI>
<LI>Fixed problem with Plot Pack zooming when using Logarithmic scales.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Plot Pack Differential Interpolation drawing algorithm problem.&nbsp; The last data point should draw to infinity.&nbsp; If the last data point went out of view, the infinity line would incorrectly disappear.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem where an additional pointer would be added to our gauge components every time you loaded the project in Visual Basic.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Theme problem where width and height of preview component would be switched if the orientation of the component was opposite of the default setting.</LI>
<LI>Fixed GetBytesJPEG memory leak and speed issues.</LI>
<LI>Fixed recursive painting bug when using stacked axes in the Plot Pack.&nbsp; This only became obvious with large, viewable data sets.</LI>
<LI>Fixed OPCItem browser limitation of 256 computers when browsing a Windows computer domain.&nbsp; The limit has been upgraded to support approximately 1000 computers per domain when browsing.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug during development under Windows 95a/b where the component would appear to be unlicensed.&nbsp; This did not affect deployed applications under Windows 95a/b, only development.</LI>
<LI>Fixed runtime property editor bug with plot pack when running under large fonts.&nbsp; Form would not automatically scale properly to large fonts.</LI>
<LI>Fixed memory leak in iKeyboard drawing algorithm.</LI>
<LI>Corrected ActiveX sizing problem in RSView.</LI>
<LI>Fixed iObjectCanvas OnClickObject event.&nbsp; The event handler was not firing correctly.</LI></OL>

<H4>New Features:</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Added to iPlotChannelCustom, DrawStartIndex and DrawStopIndex that inform you of the data point indexes that are currently visible in the Data View.</LI>
<LI>Added OnBeforeLoadProperties and OnAfterLoadProperties events added to Plot Pack Components.</LI>
<LI>Added Width, Height, Left, and Top properties for ActiveX containers that do not provide these properties by default.&nbsp; These properties are specified in pixels.&nbsp; If the container overrides these properties&nbsp; then the container will be responsible for these properties.&nbsp; For example, Visual Basic overrides these properties and replaces them with its own container properties.&nbsp; Its container properties are specified in Twips by default and not in Pixels.</LI>
<LI>Added UserCanAddRemoveChannels property.&nbsp; This property controls whether the Add/Remove buttons are shown in the Runtime Property Editor.</LI>
<LI>Added SaveAnnotationsToFile and LoadAnnotationsFromFile methods to the Plot Pack Components.&nbsp; This method should be called after loading properties from a file since the loading of properties clears out the entire control.</LI>
<LI>Added ZoomToFit context sensitive menu item and method to the X and Y-Axis Objects </LI>
<LI>Added OnBeforeZoomBox event to Plot Pack Components.&nbsp; <BR>
<I><U>VCL and CLX Components</I></U>: Passes two parameters by pointer that you can modify, ZoomRect and Cancel.&nbsp; ZoomRect has the pixel coordinates of the zoom box that can be easily converted to Axes values.&nbsp; Cancel allows you to cancel the Zoom Box if you wish.<BR>
<I><U>ActiveX Components</I></U>: Passes five parameters by pointer that you can modify, Left, Right, Top, Bottom, and Cancel. The four coordinate parameters have the pixel coordinates of the zoom box that can be easily converted to Axes values.&nbsp; Cancel allows you to cancel the Zoom Box if you wish.</LI>
<LI>Added four new methods to Plot Pack Annotation Object: PositionXToPixels, PositionYToPixels, PixelsXToPosition, PixelsYToPosition for converting pixel coordinates to position values. </LI>
<LI>Added one new method to Plot Pack Annotation Object: UserCanSize which allows the application end-user to resize the rectangle annotation objects.</LI>
<LI>Added two new styles to the Plot Pack Channel Data Marker Styles: VerticalLine and HorizontalLine.</LI>
<LI>Updated Plot Pack Axes Tracking Style characteristics for SmoothScroll.&nbsp; Before, this style would only scroll when the new value was greater than the max of the axis.&nbsp; The new characteristic is to scroll when the new value is greater than the max or less than the min. </LI>
<LI>Added new event handler to the Plot Pack: OnAnnotationCoordinatesChange and OnAnnotationCoordinatesChangeFinished events which allows you to handle changes of the X, Y, X2, Y2, Width, Height, or any other future position/size property of Annotation.&nbsp; This event is generally used in conjunction with the UserCanMove and UserCanSize properties which allows your application end-users to move and size Annotation Objects.&nbsp; The event will fire from user generated events as well as changes to the position/size of annotations by your code. </LI>
<LI>Added Bar support to the iPlot component channel object. </LI>
<LI>Added LabelsVisible property to the Axis Objects (X and Y-Axes) of the Plot Components.&nbsp; This property allows you to hade the axes labels, showing only the axes tick marks </LI>

GridLineYMinorStyle&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Added FocusHandle property to keyboard control.&nbsp; Allows setting the window handle of the component that will receive keystrokes. </LI>
<LI>All ActiveX components upgraded to include Width, Height, Enabled, and Visible properties.&nbsp; Non-visible components (such as the timer components) do not contain these properties.&nbsp; These properties are provided for ActiveX containers that do not already supply their own version of these properties. </LI>
<LI>Added Image Annotation style.&nbsp; Includes built-in image list for use with Annotations and other future uses. </LI>
<LI>Added three built-in custom image lists that you can use with Image Annotations.&nbsp; Images must be loaded at design-time. </LI>
<LI>Upgraded Plot Pack Data Cursor to convert Carriage Return and Line Feed characters to a single space in the Data Cursor Tool Tip to avoid strange characters. </LI>
<LI>Added new OPC methods to Instrumentation and Professional Pack Components. <BR>
OPCItemUpdateSuspend which allow deactivation of updates from the server.<BR>
OPCItemUpdateResume which allow re-activation of updates from the server after suspension by using OPCItemUpdateSuspend.<BR>
GetOPCItemData<BR>
GetOPCItemTimeStamp<BR>
GetOPCItemQuality<BR>
SetOPCItemData </LI>
<LI>Added new OPC event: OnOPCData which will notify you every time an update is received from the OPC Server.&nbsp; The standard component events (such as OnPositionChange in the iKnob control) are only fired when an update that changes the current component property. </LI>
<LI>Added to MarkersTurnOffLimit iPlotChannelCustom object.&nbsp; This allows you to suppress the drawing of DataMarkers according to the limit set here.&nbsp; If the number of DataMarkers to display is greater than this value, all DataMarkers for the channel will not be drawn.&nbsp; This speeds up drawing operations when displaying large numbers of data points on the screen. </LI>
<LI>Added CopyToClipBoardFormat property to Plot Pack.&nbsp; Possible selections are Bitmap, Metafile, and JPEG. </LI>
<LI>Added the following event handlers to the Plot Pack.&nbsp; Each event passes four parameters: Index of the Object, Cancel Flag By Reference, ScreenX in Pixels, and ScreenY in Pixels.<BR>
OnPopupMenuChannel<BR>
OnPopupMenuXAxis<BR>
OnPopupMenuYAxis<BR>
OnPopupMenuToolBar<BR>
OnPopupMenuLegend<BR>

<LI>Updated Plot Pack Digital Channel to support FastDraw. </LI>
<LI>Added new property to Axis object: GridLinesVisible. </LI>
<LI>Upgraded CubicSpline and Interpolation Trace styles to support empty and null data points.&nbsp; Empty data points will be skipped.&nbsp; Null Data points will generate a break in the trace line. </LI>
<LI>Added the following new properties and methods to the iPlotChannelCustom (channel object for all Plot Components)...<BR>
<BR>
DataPointSize - the number of bytes used by each data point added to the chart.<BR>
MaxDataPoints - the maximum theoretical number of data points that you can fit into the chart.&nbsp; For 32-bit Windows, this represents the maximum theoretical number of data points that will fit into the 2GBprocess memory limitation ( minus the 
applications' memory footprint)&nbsp; imposed by Windows.<BR>
Capacity - the number of data points that have been <BR>
MemoryUsed - the currently allocated memory used by the data buffer.&nbsp; This value is in bytes.<BR>
<BR>
DataStyle - specifies the features available to the data points.&nbsp; The Compact Style uses 8 bytes per data point, and stores X and Y data point data with Single Precision.&nbsp; This style loses features regarding individual data marker styles in exchange for a smaller memory footprint.&nbsp; The Standard Style uses 24 bytes per data point, and stores X and Y data point data with Double Precision.&nbsp; The Standard Style allows for use of the individual data point data marker styles.&nbsp; The Full Feature Style has extended features that is open for future expansion </LI>
<LI>iAnalogOutput, iAnalogDisplay, and iEdit have the following properties added...<BR>
ErrorActive - When True, then the following three properties control the display of the error drawn on the control.<BR>
ErrorFont<BR>

ErrorBackgroundColor </LI>
<LI>Added GetOPCItemActive to the ActiveX components. </LI>
<LI>Added AutoError to the OPC item.&nbsp; For VCL components, access the OPC item object to access AutoError.&nbsp; For ActiveX, use the GetOPCItemAutoError and SetOPCItemAutoError methods.&nbsp; If AutoError is True, then if the quality of the OPC data received from the OPC Server is not good, then the ErrorActive property of the component will be set to True.&nbsp; If the OPC Server data is good, then the ErrorActive property of the component will be set to False.&nbsp; When the OPC item is connected to the server, and AutoError is set to True, the ErrorActive property is automatically set to True indicating that the component is in an invalid state. </LI>

<LI>Upgraded iEdit and iAnalogOutput to inherit from our own custom iEditCustom control.&nbsp; Since these controls no longer inherit from the Windows API or QT API Edit-box control, they no longer have the bugs and inconsistencies that come along with the API controls. </LI>
<LI>Upgraded iModeComboBox&nbsp; control to inherit from our own custom combo box control.&nbsp; Since this control no longer inherits from the Windows API or QT API combo-box control, it no longer has the bugs and inconsistencies that come along with the API control. </LI>

<LI>Added AddXYArray method to Plot Pack Channel object.&nbsp; Allows the addition of 2-dimensional Variant Arrays to Channel that contain X and Y coordinate data. </LI>
<LI>Limits upgraded to support streaming. </LI>
<LI>Annotations now clip to axes.&nbsp; Beneficial when you have stacked axes and you don't want annotations dragging or bleeding into other axis regions. </LI>
<LI>Added PrintDocumentName property to Plot Pack components to specify the name of the document that is displayed on compatible printers when the chart is being printed.</LI></OL>
