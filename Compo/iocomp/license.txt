SOFTWARE LICENSE
The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.

I. LICENSE GRANT. This LICENSE grants you the following rights:
A. You may use one copy of the Iocomp SOFTWARE identified above on a single computer. The SOFTWARE is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage devise) of that computer. However, installation on a network server for the sole purpose of internal distribution to one or more other computer(s) shall not constitute "use" for which a separate license is required, provided you have a separate license for each computer to which the SOFTWARE is distributed.
B. Solely with respect to electronic documents included with the SOFTWARE, you may make a copy (either in hardcopy or electronic form), provided that the number of copies made shall not exceed the number of licenses you own for that SOFTWARE, and further provided that such copies shall be used only for internal purposes and are not republished or distributed to any third party.
C. You may use the trial versions and product tours, as described on the CD-ROM, of the software products included on this CD-ROM for the limited purposes of demonstrations, trials and design time evaluations and running a product tour.

II. TITLE; COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animation, video, audio, music, text and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE are owned by IOCOMP or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted material, except that you may either (A) make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archival purposes or (B) install the SOFTWARE on a single computer provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes. You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE.

III. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

C. Rental. You may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE.
D. Software Transfer. You may NOT transfer any of your rights under this LICENSE.
E. Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, Iocomp may terminate this LICENSE if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this LICENSE. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE.
F. The Source Code to portions of the Software is provided by Iocomp in an installation package to any Licensee that is authorized, provided that Licensee has purchased the Std, Pro, Plot or Ultra Pack (ActiveX/VCL) version license. Source Code is only provided for the (.Net) version when a (.Net) Site/OEM license is purchased and a NDA (Non-Disclosure-Agreement) is signed and returned to Iocomp by the Licensee.

If Licensee is authorized to receive the product Source Code, Iocomp grants Licensee the non-exclusive license to view and modify the Source Code for the sole purposes of education and troubleshooting. If Licensee troubleshoots the Source Code, Licensee may compile the corrected source code and use and distribute the resulting object code solely as a replacement for the corresponding Redistributable Files the Source Code compiles into. 

The foregoing license is subject to the following conditions: (i) Iocomp shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to all corrections, modifications and derivative works of the Source Code created by Licensee, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such corrections, modifications or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the Source Code; (ii) Licensee may not distribute or disclose the Source Code, or any portions or modifications or derivative works thereof, to any third party, in source code form; (iii) Licensee acknowledges that the Source Code contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of Iocomp and agrees to expend every effort to insure its confidentiality; (iv) Under no circumstances may the Source Code be used, in whole or in part, as the basis for creating a product that provides the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any Iocomp product; (v) If Licensee distributes a compiled version of the corrected Source Code or portions thereof, Licensee must distribute it in accordance with the conditions listed in section IV ("REDISTRIBUTABLE COMPONENTS") regarding the distribution of Redistributable Files.
