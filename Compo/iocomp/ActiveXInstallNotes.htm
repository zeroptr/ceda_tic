  <li>If you are upgrading from version 2.x, it is recommended to first install Version 
  2.x SP7 (or higher),
    open, modify, and save your existing projects.  This step will ensure that there are no 
    compatibility problems with default component properties that are changed in this version.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Visual C++ users <b><i> must</i></b> regenerate wrappers for components in existing projects
    to utilize new features/methods. To regenerate wrappers, do one of the
    following...
    <br>
    &nbsp; a.&nbsp; Re-insert all ActiveX components that you use into your project,
    letting Visual C++ regenerate wrappers for you.<br>
    &nbsp; b.&nbsp; Start a new project, insert all ActiveX components that you use
    into your project, and then copy the resulting ActiveX wrappers to your old
    project.
  </li>
  <li><b><i>Visual Studio.NET Conversion Note</i></b>: If you are converting an
    older Visual Basic 5/6 applications to Visual Basic.NET and you have set the
    TRANSPARENCY property of our components to TRUE at design-time, then you may
    run into problems during the conversion process.&nbsp; To avoid any issues,
    please set the Transparency property of the Iocomp components to FALSE in
    your Visual Basic 5/6 project and then save the project before beginning the
    conversion process.&nbsp; Add code to your form load event to turn on
    Transparency at run-time instead of turning Transparency on at
    design-time.&nbsp;
