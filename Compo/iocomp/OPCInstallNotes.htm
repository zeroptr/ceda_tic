<p>This and future releases will include support for OPC client connections to
OPC Servers. OPC is OLE for Process Control which allows our components to
communicate with OPC Servers sold with many popular factory floor and automation
hardware without writing code.</p>
<p>Please refer to the License Agreement for information about OPC Distribution
License requirements or contact Iocomp Software. For installer related questions
or bug reports, please submit a copy to <a href="mailto:support@iocomp.com">support@iocomp.com</a>

<p>ActiveX and VCL Users</p>
</b>
<ol>
  <li>The Iocomp Components Product Installer will install several required DLLs
    and EXEs on your computer for support of our OPC features.</li>
  <li>If you intend to utilize the OPC features of our components, a
    distribution license will need to be obtained from Iocomp Software or your
    Iocomp Authorized Reseller.</li>
  <li>Additional files that were installed on your development computer will
    need to be distributed to your end-users for the OPC client features to
    function correctly. We have provided a copy of all of the necessary OPC
    files and dependency files in a directory named &quot;OPC Distributables&quot;
    located in our installation directory. The required OPC files necessary for
    our components are as follows...<b><br>
    <br>
    OPC Support Files</b><br>
    opcenum.exe<br>
    OPCProxy.dll<br>
    opccomn_ps.dll<br>
    aprxdist.exe {only needed if IE 3.x or higher not installed}<br>
  iOPC.dll</li>
</ol>

<p>Installation on End-User Computer</p>
</b>
<p>We have an installation program on our website that can install the required
OPC files on your end user system.&nbsp; You can download this installer from
our <a href="http://www.iocomp.com/download">Download Section</a>.&nbsp; You can 
also download various OPC End-User installation packages and installation 
components directly from the OPC Foundation at
<a href="http://www.opcfoundation.org">http://www.opcfoundation.org</a></p>
<p>If you plan on creating your own installer for your product, read on...</p>
<p>The two DLL files &quot;OPCProxy.dll&quot; and &quot;opccomn_ps.dll&quot; will need to be registered on your end-users computer using
regsvr32 or with your installation program's automatic registration option. The opcenum.exe program will need to be registered by executing &quot;opcenum /regserver&quot;
on the command line or through your installation program's shell command. All
four files should be placed in the Window's System or System32 directory.</p>
<b><i>
<p>Manual Installation From Command Line</p>
</i></b>
<p>Run the following commands from your Windows System directory (Windows
95/98/ME) or your Windows System32 directory (WinNT/2000/XP/2003)...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ocpenum /regserver<br>
  regsvr32 OPCProxy.dll<br>
  regsvr32 opccomn_ps.dll</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the End-User's computer does not have Internet Explorer 3.x or higher
installed, you will need to distribute aprxdist.exe from Microsoft's Technical
Support or from our OPC Distributables directory that was installed when you
installed our software. This will installed critical OLE support files that come
with IE 3.x and higher. This installation of aprxdist.exe is only required on
Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 as higher versions of Windows already have Internet
Explorer 4.x or higher installed by default.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: other OPC client or OPC Server vendors may have already
installed these support files on your system. It is critical that you do version
checking on these files and that you increment the installation counter for
these files in the Windows registry using your Install Program's Shared File
features. Also, these three files are the minimum number of OPC support files
needed by our components. Other OPC clients or OPC servers may require other OPC
files which are not supplied by Iocomp Software. For more information or
updates, refer to the OPC Foundation's Website at <a href="http://www.opcfoundation.org">http://www.opcfoundation.org</a></p>

<p>DCOM Configuration on Development and End-User Computer</p>
</b>
<p>Configuration of DCOM on your computer varies depending on your the security
model of the Windows installation at your company's site. DCOM is generally
already setup by default to work correctly with our OPC clients. However, each
company's security settings and security policies are different, so we cannot
completely cover DCOM configuration here. Please contact Iocomp Support for
assistance or refer to Microsoft Technical Support documentation for more
information.</p>
