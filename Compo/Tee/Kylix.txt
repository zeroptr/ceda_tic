100% Full Source Code

---------------------------

Installation in Kylix
=====================

1) Copy the Sources folder to a Linux
folder under your "home".

  For example, if you log as root:

  # cp sources/* /root/TeeChart

2) Compile the TeeChart packages

 It seems Kylix does not allow compiling
 packages that depend on other packages,
 all at the same time from the Kylix IDE.

 A workaround is to compile the TeeChart
 packages manually from a console window.

 
 Use the included KylixRecompile shell
 script gently provided by 

  Martin Kaul (mkaul@leuze.de)


 NOTE: 
 =====

  Before using the "KylixRecompile" script, 
  type this to convert from Windows to Linux
  end-of-line characters:

  "dos2unix KylixRecompile"


 ...or you can make a shell script to do
 the following:

 # source /root/kylix/bin/kylixpath
 # make -f Tee8K3.bpg

 (Where "root" is your login home folder)

 After compiling, you should copy the 
 output package files to Kylix folders,
 to make easier Kylix find them:

 # cp bpl*Tee8K3*.so /root/kylix/bin
 # cp dcl*Tee8K3*.so /root/kylix/bin
 # cp *.dcp /root/kylix/lib

 Important:
 Every time you want to recompile, it might
 be necessary to remove the TeeChart *.dcp files
 from Kylix lib folder:

 # rm /root/kylix/lib/Tee*.dcp

3) Run Kylix

 # startkylix  (or use the Gnome/KDE menu)

4) Install the packages

   Component->Install Packages->Add...

  Select and install the dclTee8K3.so,
  dclTeePro8K3.so and bplTeeImage8K3.so packages.


Compiling applications:
=======================

Kylix needs the correct path to find the
compiled units (*.dpu files), so it can
compile your projects.

Project->Options->Directories->Search Path
