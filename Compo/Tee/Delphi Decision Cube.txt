Steema Software
Rebuilding Borland's Decision Cube packages.
--------------------------------------------

When TeeChart Pro is installed in the Enterprise
versions of Delphi and C++ Builder, the Decision
Cube packages are automatically disabled because TeeChart
Pro packages are different than the ones included by 
default in Delphi / C++ Builder.

With the release of Enterprise versions, source
code files for the Decision Cube components are included,
so it's possible to recompile the Decision Cube packages
using TeeChart Pro following these steps:

Instructions to recompile:

Option 1: Automatic
====================

Use the included application DCubeRecomp.exe to
recompile the Decision Cube components.
This program makes a copy of every modified file, 
prefixing the file name with "BackupOf_" text.

Option 2: Manually
====================

1. Download and install TeeChart Pro.
   (Available at www.steema.com, Customer Downloads)

2. Select "Components->Install packages", and remove
   "Borland Decision Cube components" with the "Remove" button.

3. Locate the Decision Cube source code. 
   It should be in the Delphi / C++ Builder :
   "\Source\Decision Cube" directory.

4. Open the DSS70.dpk package. Remove the Tee.dcp package and add 
   (on the same place) the Tee77.dcp package and recompile. If you
   get a complaint about "always built package with the newer built...",
   then click on "Options" speed button and change:
   "Build control" to "Rebuild as needed", and recompile.

5. Then open the DclDSS70.dpk package and remove the DclTee70.dcp 
   package and replace it with the DclTee77.dcp package. 
   Change "Build control" to "Rebuild as needed" and recompile.

6. Copy the new DSS70.bpl to Windows \System directory, DclDSS70.bpl 
   to Delphi / C++ Builder \Bin directory and all the 
   *.dcu and *.dcp files to Delphi / C++ Builder \Lib directory.

7. Select "Component->Install packages" menu and click the "Add" button.
   Then select the new DclDSS70.bpl package, located at the 
   \Bin directory.
