Rebuilding Borland's Decision Cube packages in C++ Builder 6.
-------------------------------------------------------------

When TeeChart Pro is installed in C++ Builder, the Decision
Cube packages are automatically disabled because TeeChart
Pro 5 packages are different to the ones included by 
default in C++ Builder.

C++ Builder Enterprise includes source code files for 
the Decision Cube components, so it's possible to recompile 
the Decision Cube packages using TeeChart Pro following these steps:

Instructions to recompile:

1. Download and install TeeChart Pro for C++ Builder.
   (Available at www.steema.com, Customer Downloads)

2. Select "Components->Install packages" in C++ Builder, and remove
   "Borland Decision Cube components" with the "Remove button.

3. Manually remove all compiled Decision Cube files from C++ Builder \Lib\ ,
   \Lib\Obj , \Include\vcl\ and windows \System\ (or \System32\) directories.

4. Locate the Decision Cube source code. It should be in the CBuilder
   \Source\Decision Cube directory.

5. Since C++ Builder Decision Cube source code does not include 
   *.bpk (packages) files, you'll have to manually build dss60.bpk and
   dcldss60.bpk packages.

   dss60.bpk package:

   + Create new package : "File->New->Package"
   + Save new package as dss60.bpk : "File->SaveAs"
   + Add the following files to "Contains" section : mxarrays.pas, 
     mxbutton.pas, mxcommon.pas, mxConsts.pas, mxDB.pas, mxDCube.pas, 
     mxdsql.pas, mxgraph,pas, mxgrid.pas, mxpbar.pas, mxpivsrc.pas, 
     mxqedcom.pas, mxparse.pas, mxstore.pas, mxtables.pas
   + Add the following files to "Requires" section : Tee7C6.bpi,
     vcl60.bpi, dbrtl60.bpi bdertl60.bpi, vcldb60.bpi
   + Save package
   
   dcldss60.bpk package:

   + Create new package : "File->New->Package"
   + Save new package as dcldss60.bpk : "File->SaveAs"
   + Add the following files to "Contains" section : mxdconts.pas,
     mxdimedt.pas, mxdssqry.pas, mxreg.pas
   + Edit mxreg.pas file : replace ChartReg with TeeChartReg (Uses section).
     Save mxreg.pas file.
   + Add the following files to "Requires" section : dss60.bpi,
     dcltee7c6.bpi
   + Go to "Project->Option Source" menu item. Locate <PFLAGS value= section.
     Add -luVCL60 to PFlags section:
     <PFLAGS value="-$YD -$W -$O- -v -JPHNE -M -luVCL60"/>
   + Save package


6. Recompile dss60.bpk packages.If you get a complaint about 
   "always built package with the newer built...", then click on "Options" 
   speed button and change: "Build control" to "Rebuild as needed", and 
   recompile.

7. Copy the new DSS60.bpl to Windows \System directory. Copy all 
   newly compiled *.bpi, *.lib, to \Lib\ , *.dcu *.obj to \Lib\Obj and *.hpp 
   files to the CBuilder \include\vcl directory. 

8. Copy the newly recompiled DclDSS60.bpl to C++Builder \Bin directory, 
   newly compiled *.bpi, *.lib, to \Lib\ , *.dcu *.obj to \Lib\Obj and *.hpp 
   files to the C++Builder \include\vcl directory.

9. Select "Component->Install packages" menu and click the "Add" button.
   Then select the new DclDSS60.bpl package, located in 
   C++Builder \Bin directory.

NOTE : 

  When you recompile Decision Cube files it's very important C++ Builder
  is no longer referencing any old Decision Cube compiled files !
