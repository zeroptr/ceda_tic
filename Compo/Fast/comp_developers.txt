This file describes changes in FastReport 4 related to custom components 
development.

- The component icon size is 16x16 pixels.

- There is no toolbar categories (frxObjects.RegisterCategory) in FastReport 4. 
However you may still use it.

- You don't need to use FImageIndex or Bitmap in non-visual components 
(TfrxDialogComponent ancestors). It's enough to setup an icon when registering
the component (frxObjects.Register). This icon will be used to draw a component.

- The wizard's icon size is 16x16 pixels for toolbar wizard and 32x32 pixels
for File|New... wizard.
