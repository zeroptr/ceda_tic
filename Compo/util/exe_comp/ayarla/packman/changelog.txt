February 3, 2006: Version 1.0
- Completely recoded (only listing major changes).
- Removed tooltips and added help file, contents, and an about dialog.
- Added selectable compression algorithm support via compression libraries.
- Added support for "in-place" packing and it is now the default mode.
- Seperated "compress sections" mode into "max (old header) and "max (new header)".
- Added code filtering support.
- Added an option to backup and restore the original file header at runtime.
- Added overlay support.
- Removed the "Null Relocated Data" option (it is always on now).
- Changed all the "Rip" options to "Strip" options. They basically have the opposite meaning now.
- Fixed TLS support so that it actually works.

- Added Strip Relocations option.
- Added support for forcing section compression instead of just excluding section compression.
- Resource filtering is now more advanced with the ability to narrow a filter to more than just the level 1 directory.

- Due to the recoding, should compress many more executables successfully.
- Source is now available!
