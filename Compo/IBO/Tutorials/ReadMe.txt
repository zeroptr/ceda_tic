This directory is intended to contain all donated tutorials written on
a voluntary basis by developers such as yourself. They are intended 
primarily to assist the beginner just getting started. Or, they may 
address specific topics of IBO.

I have long forgotten what its like to be a beginner with this product 
and feel that peer input is much more valuable than mine. I am hoping 
that by reading eachothers' "getting started" tutorials that the 
learning process can be greatly accellerated.

Plese realize that these contributions represent the good will of 
others. I'd like to extend my thanks to all those who have contributed 
in this manner and I hope that you will benefit greatly from them.

Some of the contents well suited for the new IBO.HLP file may have 
been transferred there.

Thanks,
